A Multitude of Climates

Climate change and human involvement in it has long been a driving force of political talking points. While atmospheric measurements show continual increases in carbon dioxide and global average temperatures continue to go up, a debate rages on about how much of this is caused by the human species and how much of an impact it will have on our environment. Considering this, it’s interesting and useful to look at the dramatic changes in climate that have happened on Earth throughout its existence. As it turns out, humans aren’t the first species to have a major, sudden effect on the climate. Other life has abruptly shifted the contents of the atmosphere, and not without momentous impact on the creatures alive at the time.
We’ll actually begin not on Earth itself, but on its neighboring planets, Venus and Mars. When trying to understand how things work it’s best to have multiple samples. These two planets each have a climate that used to be much more like Earth’s, but both have taken a turn for the worse.
The term “runaway greenhouse effect” originally comes from the study of Venus. Despite the evidence that it once had oceans of water and many other Earth-like qualities, Venus today is often seen as being the closest approximation we have to hell. The surface is continually repaved with molten rock, the clouds and rains are made of sulfuric acid, the temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure is a crushing 90 times that of Earth’s. A runaway greenhouse effect started the current condition of this world. The ancient oceans Venus is thought to have had became hot enough to boil, forming a thicker atmosphere which would trap more heat and boil the oceans faster in a repeated feedback loop. Ultraviolet light from the Sun in the upper atmosphere split the hydrogen and oxygen in the water vapor, and the lighter hydrogen escaped into space. This left the oxygen with no way to form water again. Today, there is almost no water vapor left on Venus, and the greenhouse effect from the carbon dioxide remaining in the atmosphere holds the planet in its terrible state. It’s important to note here that Earth would not become hot enough to have a boiling ocean runaway effect even if we burned all the carbon dioxide trapped in the oil, coal, and natural gas in the Earth’s crust—though that’s not to say this wouldn’t have other consequences. On the other hand, the Earth will eventually undergo this runaway effect in a few billion years as the Sun continues to become brighter.
On the other side of Earth is the red planet. Unlike Venus, it's certain that Mars used to have water on its surface—dried river deltas and lake beds are scattered across it. Today, ice uncovered by the Mars rovers simply sublimates (converts directly from a solid to gas) and the entire surface is bone dry. The atmosphere isn’t suitable for liquid water, even though it surely once was. What exactly happened to Mars’ atmosphere isn’t known, but it assuredly is worthwhile to find out even if for no other reason than to be prevent such a fate on Earth.
Returning to Earth, we find that it has had a far from stable climate over its lifetime and even previous inhabitants which have fiddled with the atmospheric dials. As humans we think of "air" as almost synonymous with "oxygen", yet the early atmosphere of Earth included almost no free oxygen. Oxygen simply isn’t chemically stable by itself and quickly bonds with other things to form molecules such as carbon dioxide. Without something churning out a constant supply, oxygen won’t stick around for long, and at the time nothing was providing this supply. The bacterial life that existed at the time had to rely on other chemical sources to grow and flourish. Then, around 2.4 billion years ago, along came the "cyanobacteria" with their newly developed ability of photosynthesis and the byproduct of oxygen that comes with it. To us, oxygen sounds like a good thing—we all need it to live. However, life at the time had never dealt with oxygen before, and, for much of it, it was a deadly poison. At first, the the new molecule didn’t cause a problem as the newly produced oxygen would just quickly bond with the iron in the water. But photosynthesis is a powerful process which allowed the cyanobacteria grow and spread rapidly. When the unbonded iron in the water ran out, the atmosphere was quickly (in geological terms) pumped full of oxygen. This was known as the Oxygen Catastrophe. This poison flooded the planet and drove vast swaths of the bacterial species to extinction. Yet this extinction was only a minor part of the catastrophe. The oxygen reacted with the methane in the atmosphere producing carbon dioxide. Though carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, methane is a much stronger one. Without the methane and due to the Sun being less bright than it is today, the global temperatures plummeted and the Earth began to freeze. As more ice formed, it reflected even more of the Sun’s rays and it became colder still. If not all, nearly the entire surface of the planet froze creating what is known as Snowball Earth. The Earth remained a frozen world for 300 million years.
Sometimes, the changes in climate happen in a much shorter timeframe. Unquestionably, the most famous extinction event is that which brought an end to the dinosaurs. On the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, there is a crater 110 miles in diameter—the Chicxulub Crater. This is the site of the explosion of the astronomic bomb that exterminated not only the dinosaurs, but 70 percent of all species alive 65 million years ago. Upon impact, the asteroid exploded with more energy than that of ten thousand fold of every nuclear weapon on Earth if they were to all go off at once. The explosion was certainly devastating, but it was really the climate conditions the asteroid impact started that rendered these creatures extinct. As the asteroid plunged through the Earth’s atmosphere, it blasted aside air leaving a temporary vacuum behind. The explosion vaporized an enormous area of land and, helped by the pull of the previously mentioned vacuum, sent the particles flying back into space to encompass the globe. All this matter came plummeting back into the atmosphere across the planet. When you see a shooting star, it’s typically caused by something not much larger than a grain of sand coming into the atmosphere more than 50 miles away from you. In this case, those little streaks of light completely covered the sky to a point that the entire sky would have seemed on fire. The heat from this caused a global conflagration likely burned down the majority of the land plants on the planet—and perhaps all plants and animals that wasn’t physically wet or underground. Immediately after the rain of fire, the dust and ash in the air would have mostly blotted out the sun for more than a year. Most this time, there would be too little light for photosynthesis and to keep most creatures warm. After this dust settled, there were still problems for those creatures that had survived so far. The forest fires had released large amounts of carbon dioxide leading to a temporary greenhouse effect which caused another shift in temperature for the battered populations. On top of this, the vaporization of the sulfuric bed of material that the asteroid had impacted led to large amounts of acidic matter in the air. This resulted in acid rains for a decade after the impact.
While the Oxygen Catastrophe and the Chicxulub Impact were both major upheavals in Earth’s history, they pale in comparison to the climate event that happened 250 million years ago. This was the time of the Permian–Triassic extinction, known as the Great Dying. To understand everything that happened here, we first need to go back about another 50 million years to the Carboniferous period. This is when plants first developed Lignin and with it the ability to grow into tall trees. With the advantage of new found height, trees spread to cover the globe. Unfortunately, other creatures had not yet developed the ability to digest the Lignin. When a tree fell, its corpse remained with no way to be eaten or decayed. Over the years, the wood piled up and was buried by dirt and mud. It’s from the buried trees of this period that many of the coal deposits around the world are formed.
Jumping forward 50 million years, we come to the cataclysm. In what is now Siberia, volcanic eruptions began and continued for hundreds of thousands of years. More than a million square miles were buried by lava gushing from the fissures. This endless series of eruptions spewed ash and carbon dioxide perpetually into the air. The ash covered the land in a freezing darkness, all the while the carbon dioxide built up in the atmosphere. The lava flows ignited the enormous coal beds that were laid down by the uneaten Carboniferous forests. These smoldering coal fields streamed their own supplies of sulfuric haze, methane, and carbon dioxide into the sky, multiplying the effects of the volcanoes. When the ash and haze settled, the greenhouse gases remained. The Earth shifted from a frigid cold to a brutal heat, and from here things only got worse.
The waters began to warm, and methane rich ices in the ocean floor sediments began to melt. As these gases surfaced, they contributed to the greenhouse effect, which caused more methane rich ices to melt in a runaway fashion. Ocean currents were completely disrupted by the changing temperatures and oxygen circulation all but stopped. The oxygen starved water choked and killed the vast majority of the fish in the sea. While life was perishing left and right, one type of being thrived: anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria. The bacteria, spreading like wildfire, pumped out huge quantities of hydrogen sulfide. This poisonous gas stifled the remaining land creatures. Further still, the hydrogen sulfide and methane both deteriorated the ozone layer and expose animals and plants to deadly levels of ultraviolet radiation.
It’s hard to tell which parts of this disaster caused the greatest damage and if there were even more causes involved that we don’t yet have evidence for. However, the evidence of the destruction is clearly written in the fossil record. Nine out of every ten species was eradicated from the face of the Earth. The Great Dying is by far the largest extinction event known. Another 30 million years had to pass before life had recovered from this devastating blow.
In the current day, humans have begun fiddling with the atmospheric knobs of the world, like the cyanobacteria before us. Cries to “Save the Earth” are really about saving the human race—and often the other life we share the planet with. The Earth itself would be fine no matter what we did to it. Humans have no conceivable way to destroy the enormous mass that is the Earth. It will continue to orbit the Sun happily despite any tiny things we do on the surface. The much smaller task of completely extinguishing life on this planet is also far beyond the reach of humans. Even if all humans deliberately tried to make Earth completely uninhabitable for life, there’s really no chance we could accomplish this. However, we can certainly cause mass climatic changes, we can cause global extinctions, and we can topple the ecosystems that sustain many species on Earth, including our own.
We’re only here because the dinosaurs were wiped out by an asteroid impact. If we too are driven to extinction—by our own doing or not—another intelligent species of the future will surely be glad of that extinction which made room for them. Whatever we do, life on Earth will recover—it just might take a few million years and not include us.
