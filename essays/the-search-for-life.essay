The Search For Life
For centuries people have looked toward the sky and wondered if there might be life on distant planets. Even early Greek philosophers such as Democritus believed there might be infinite worlds like Earth inhabited by living beings. With the development of the Sun-centered view of the universe in the 1600s, astronomers began to wonder whether the other planets or even the Moon were thriving with life. By the 1800s, it was known that the Moon had no atmosphere, so people shifted their attention toward Mars. The astronomer Percival Lowell constructed a mighty mountaintop observatory and saw what he believed to be artificial canals built on Mars. He postulated that a desperate civilization on a dying planet was channeling water from the Martian polar ice caps to the cities near the equator. Unfortunately, all he was seeing was an optical illusion.
Today we realize the rest of the solar system is not hospitable to human life. If a human being were placed anywhere but Earth they would die almost instantly. Yet, despite this, the potential for finding extraterrestrial life in the universe is greater now than ever before. Thousands of planets around other stars have been discovered, microorganisms are found thriving in the most extreme conditions, and even our own solar system still has high hopes for life beyond Earth.
The first exoplanet—a planet orbiting a star other than the Sun—was detected in 1988, but could not be confirmed until more powerful telescopes were utilized in 2003. Since then, the number of confirmed exoplanets has been rapidly rising. Every year starting with 2010 has added more than 100 exoplanets to the catalog, and just in the first 3 months of this year over 800 new planets have been confirmed. Today, about 1700 exoplanets are confirmed with around 4000 candidates on the waiting list.
Exoplanets are found using a number of techniques. Early on, we watched how huge planets—similar to Jupiter—caused their star to wobble as they mutually gravitated around each other. This wobble causes the light waves coming from the star to vary in frequency. When the star is wobbling toward us the light is bluer, and when it moves away from us it appears more red—similar to how an ambulance siren changes pitch as it passes by you. However, most of the confirmed planets have been discovered by their transits. When the planet passes in front of its star it blocks a small amount of light, making the star appear to dim by a certain constant amount for a short period of time. Only recently have telescopes been able to both block light from the star while still collecting light from the planet, thus allowing for direct observation of distant worlds.
Since we only know of life on Earth, Earth-like planets are our best bet for finding life elsewhere. “Earth-like” first means that the planet should be a similar size to Earth—large enough to have an atmosphere, but small enough not to be a gas giant. So far, the majority of the planets found have been gas giants like Jupiter, because huge planets are much easier to detect than small, Earth-sized ones. However, the number of smaller planets discovered constantly increases along with the power of our telescopes. Besides size, an Earth-like planet cannot be too hot or too cold. It should fall into the "habitable zone" of its star—a distance such that the planet's temperature allows for liquid water on the surface. Based off the current observations, it’s expected that 22% of all stars similar to the Sun have an Earth-sized planet orbiting them within the habitable zone. With 40 billion such stars, this yields approximately 8.8 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy alone. This means that there are more Earth-like planets in the Milky Way than there are humans beings on the globe.
Along with the discovery of new planets, the variety of life known on Earth continually rises. We once thought microorganisms would only propagate in a nice, warm pond. Since then, we have found everything from creatures that thrive in the superheated geothermal vents on the ocean floor to bacteria that will come back to life after being thawed out of the arctic ice. Vast multitudes of life flourish in the crust of the Earth beneath the oceans never receiving a glimpse of sunlight. These colonies show us that life may not require the habitable zone at all. The lingering heat from a planet’s core may be sufficient energy for life. Some microorganisms can survive exposure to the vacuum and radiation of space and go for years without food or water only to rehydrate and reproduce. Even a place like the Dead Sea was only named that way because its discoverers didn’t have microscopes. As it turns out, virtually every place we find liquid water on Earth, we find some form of bacterial life. From this we’re hopeful that finding liquid water will mean finding life.
Of course, water alone does not guarantee life. We have to consider how difficult it was for life to spring up in the first place out of the molecular soup of the early Earth. The Earth is 4.5 billion years old. From current fossil and geological research, we have evidence of life as early as 3.8 billion years ago or even 3.9 by some studies. This means life started only 700 million years after the formation of the planet. However, once computers became powerful enough to model the early solar system, we realized that it was a place of utter chaos. During the first 500 or 600 million years after the formation of the Earth, the solar system was in an era known as Heavy Bombardment. As the name implies, the planet was vacuuming up debris from the formation of the solar system, which rained down to the surface as asteroids. During this time, the surface of the planet was molten rock, too hot for molecules to combine and even have a chance of forming life. If you don’t start the clock until after things started to cool down, then it only took life a scant 200 million years to form.
What about the ingredients of life? What if life developed on Earth simply because it had the right rare molecules and elements to start with? If life on Earth were based primarily on Thallium, this would be a good argument, but life is made out of the most common ingredients in the universe. Ignoring helium, which is chemically inert, the most common elements in both the universe and the human body are, in order, hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon. There is no reason to expect that Earth is rare as far as ingredients go.
While we now know that there are no intelligent civilizations channeling water on Mars, it still may harbor microbial life. There are signs of ancient bodies water everywhere on the Red Planet. Dried riverbeds and ocean floors cover the Martian landscape. Current data suggests that 3.8 billion years ago up to a third of Mars’ surface was covered in water and the planet had a much thicker atmosphere. During this time, Mars may have looked similar to how Earth does today. Yet, the water is gone now, perhaps underground. NASA’s robotic emissaries are now scouring the planet for some sign of past or even present microbial life.
Recently, Jupiter’s moon Europa has become one of the most likely candidates for life in the solar system besides Earth. Europa’s surface is an icy shell, but the gravitational pull of Jupiter and its other moons causes Europa to stretch and twist. This process leads to huge amounts of friction in the core of the moon and heats it from the inside out. Today, Europa is expected to have an ocean beneath its surface twice as large as all the oceans on Earth combined. Not only that, but these oceans would have been liquid for billions of years, providing plenty of time for life to form. And if our solar system is any indication, there are far more moons than planets in the galaxy.
With all this, it seems simply egotistic to assume that we are unique in our existence. The amount of life in the Milky Way, let alone the universe, is likely grand. And there’s good chance we need only to look in our own solar system’s backyard to find it.
