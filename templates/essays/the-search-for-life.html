<p class="lead text-justify">For centuries people have looked toward the sky and wondered if there might be life on distant planets. Even early Greek philosophers such as Democritus believed there might be infinite worlds like Earth inhabited by living beings. With the development of the Sun-centered view of the universe in the 1600s, astronomers began to wonder whether the other planets or even the Moon were thriving with life. By the 1800s, it was known that the Moon had no atmosphere, so people shifted their attention toward Mars. The astronomer Percival Lowell constructed a mighty mountaintop observatory and saw what he believed to be artificial canals built on Mars. He postulated that a desperate civilization on a dying planet was channeling water from the Martian polar ice caps to the cities near the equator. Unfortunately, all he was seeing was an optical illusion.</p>

<p class="lead text-justify">Today we realize the rest of the solar system is not hospitable to human life. If a human being were placed anywhere but Earth they would die almost instantly. Yet, despite this, the potential for finding extraterrestrial life in the universe is greater now than ever before. Thousands of planets around other stars have been discovered, microorganisms are found thriving in the most extreme conditions, and even our own solar system still has high hopes for life beyond Earth.</p>

<p class="lead text-justify">The first exoplanet—a planet orbiting a star other than the Sun—was detected in 1988, but could not be confirmed until more powerful telescopes were utilized in 2003. Since then, the number of confirmed exoplanets has been rapidly rising. Every year starting with 2010 has added more than 100 exoplanets to the catalog, and just in the first 3 months of this year over 800 new planets have been confirmed. Today, about 1700 exoplanets are confirmed with around 4000 candidates on the waiting list.</p>

<p class="lead text-justify">Exoplanets are found using a number of techniques. Early on, we watched how huge planets—similar to Jupiter—caused their star to wobble as they mutually gravitated around each other. This wobble causes the light waves coming from the star to vary in frequency. When the star is wobbling toward us the light is bluer, and when it moves away from us it appears more red—similar to how an ambulance siren changes pitch as it passes by you. However, most of the confirmed planets have been discovered by their transits. When the planet passes in front of its star it blocks a small amount of light, making the star appear to dim by a certain constant amount for a short period of time. Only recently have telescopes been able to both block light from the star while still collecting light from the planet, thus allowing for direct observation of distant worlds.</p>

<p class="lead text-justify">Since we only know of life on Earth, Earth-like planets are our best bet for finding life elsewhere. “Earth-like” first means that the planet should be a similar size to Earth—large enough to have an atmosphere, but small enough not to be a gas giant. So far, the majority of the planets found have been gas giants like Jupiter, because huge planets are much easier to detect than small, Earth-sized ones. However, the number of smaller planets discovered constantly increases along with the power of our telescopes. Besides size, an Earth-like planet cannot be too hot or too cold. It should fall into the "habitable zone" of its star—a distance such that the planet's temperature allows for liquid water on the surface. Based off the current observations, it’s expected that 22% of all stars similar to the Sun have an Earth-sized planet orbiting them within the habitable zone. With 40 billion such stars, this yields approximately 8.8 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy alone. This means that there are more Earth-like planets in the Milky Way than there are humans beings on the globe.</p>

<p class="lead text-justify">Along with the discovery of new planets, the variety of life known on Earth continually rises. We once thought microorganisms would only propagate in a nice, warm pond. Since then, we have found everything</p>
